## Submitting new libraries and components

Want to add your own? Fork this site on GitHub, add your framework to "data.js" and submit a pull request.

### **1. submit pull request**

  * Add your library to "`data.js`", at the end of the file (this helps with merging many contributions) and enter the required attributes: `'name'`, `'repo'`, `'author'`, `'tags'`, `'description'`, all can't be empty(null or '').
  * The a `'repo'` should point to wherever you host your README or docs and where code is downloaded code-download.
  * The `'tags'` attribute must be a `array` of the project keywords. max array length is 4. max string size is 30.
  * Running `npm run build`, and open `index.html` with your browser, should work and not return an error. To run build, you'll need node installed, and `npm install` first.
  * Then submit a `pull request`.

### **2. submit an issue**
